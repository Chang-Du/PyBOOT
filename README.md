# PyBOOT
## author: Federica Bianco
 this is all the material developed for the CUSP NYU 2016 Python Bootcamp (September 24th 2016. 
 All the material is designed by me (taking much inspiration a number of internet resources including [http://software-carpentry.org/](http://software-carpentry.org/), [http://www.practicepython.org/](http://www.practicepython.org/) and many more.

 The list of topics I wanted to cover is in [BootcampPlan.md](BootcampPlan.md); entries written in bold were not covered
 
 A single notebook with the code written in class was generated : [inclassNB.ipynb](inclassNB.ipynb)
 
 I added an exercise to practice for loops, and printing : [LoopExercise.ipynb](LoopExercise.ipynb)

 There is also an exercise to practice for loops, and practice scripting, inline arguments, exception handling, and the time module, but we did not get to most of those topics: [printGoodmorningGoodnightExercise.py](printGoodmorningGoodnightExercise.py)
