# PyBOOT
##author: Federica Bianco
 this is all the material developed for the CUSP NYU 2016 Python Bootcamp (September 24th 2016)
 all thematerial is designed by me 

 The list of topics I wanted to cover is in [BootcampPlan.md](BootcampPlan.md); entries written in bold were not covered
 
 A single notebook with the code written in class was generated : [inclassNB.ipynb](inclassNB.ipynb)
 
 I added an exercise to practice for loops, and printing : [LoopExercise.ipynb](LoopExercise.ipynb)

 There is also an exercise to practice for loops, and practice scripting, inline arguments, exception handling, and the time module, but we did not get to most of those topics: [printGoodmorningGoodnigntExercise.py](printGoodmorningGoodnigntExercise.py)
 
## Suggestions are more than welcome! 
## Feedback can be left here _anonymously_ [here](https://github.com/fedhere/PyBOOT)
